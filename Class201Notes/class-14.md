# The Importance of Teamwork: A data driven research by Google's Project Aristotle and CSS Transitions.

## Personal Reflection:

During my time in Code Fellows 201 course I came to around week 5 or 6 the importance of the team component. After working with another student and being grouped together to discuss how to approach a problem the light came on in my mind. Teamwork in this industry in essential, especially during the learning process. After reading about Project Aristotle I feel completely seen and heard! When learning difficult concepts associated with computer languages why do it alone!? In every other profession I've had, teamwork has always been the one factor that created success, from military assignments in the Navy, to a career in IT as a System Administrator to a Instruction Chef and Life Coach. All involved heavy amounts of teamwork to get the job done. It's suprising that here and now as a student it hadn't dawned on me to implement this one key principle that I know works.
