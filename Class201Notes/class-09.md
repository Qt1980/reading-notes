#Forms and JS Events

What is a form? A form is a means by which developers use tables of some sort to track data. For instance when you type something into the google search box, that data is collected and returns an answer. Using google the answer may be returned as well as other things that are similar to the answer. This data collection is done through the form (the search box) found on the google website. 

Forms are used in various ways such as:
  Text boxes - like the search box google uses. These type of boxes are also used for sending small messages, comments and for inputting passwords.

  Selective Boxes - Checkboxes, radio buttons and drop-down boxes are all interactive ways as user might interact with the page belonging to a company. If you were listening to online radio, depending on the format of the station changer might look like small round button you'd select in order to change the station or the type of music you want to listen to.

  Submittal Forms - These are buttons used to submit larger chunks of data.

All of the different types listed about are known as form control.

## The structure of Form

In HTML, the form element is used to create a form on the webpage. 
Within the form element must be an "*action*" attribute and a method. The action attribute will always have a value of the website address (URL) of the server that will handle the inputted data.  

The end of the action value will be a *get* method. If the method is a *post* method then the value of post will be sent via the HTTPS header.

**GET** METHOD: This method is used for search boxes mainly.
**POST** METHOD: This method is used for usernames, passwords, uploading files and other things.
