# Layout with CSS cont...

With CSS the software developer can do a myriad of really exciting things. One of the recent things I've learned about it creating tables. In CSS this is done through the layout or design process. 

If a table has been created using HTML or JavaScript then it can be designed using CSS. 

I've written JS code that creates a table to show the daily cookie sales from a cookie store in five different cities. The table looks something like this:

Example:

Store Location | Hours
-------------- | ----------- 
               | 6am, 7am, 8am, 9am, 10am, 11am, 12pm
-------------- | ------------
Seattle        | 10,  20,  30,  40,  50,    60,   70
Tokyo          | 3,    5,   7,  9,   11,    13,   15

The hours from 6am to 12pm shows the number of cookies sold per hour for Seattle and Tokyo. In JS these numbers are generated randomly and added to give the store's daily totals.
