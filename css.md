# Welcome to an Indroduction to CSS

Cascading Style Sheet (CSS):Is a language that allows the developer to add color, texture and style to a webpage. This is called presentation. 

CSS allows the developer to create rules that are used with HTML elements the rules govern how the HTML content of specific elements are displayed CSS rules have two parts: a selector and a declaration.

```<p>-is a selector``` whereas ```{font-family; Arial}```- is a declaration, the "font-family" selection is called property and the "Arial" selectrion is called value. 
    - Selection: tells us which element the rule applies to.
    - Declarations: Tells us how the element will show upon the webpage. Declarations have two parts, property and value and are separation by a colon.

CSS declarations are inside curly brackets ```{}``` and can have multiple properties and values and each are separate by semi-coclon.
There are many selectors that CSS uses. See pg 238 of the Jon Duckett HTML & CSS book.

CSS can either be implement on the page or included with the HTML code or in an external casscading style sheet.css. It is common practice to always use an external stylesheet. This keeps the HTML code clean and easy to edit. 

It also allows updating css on the webpage to be a bit easier. Updating the page using an external style sheet will update all the pages of the site or all the elements on the page instead of having to update every single element individually. 

CSS applies in a top down approach and from left to right.
