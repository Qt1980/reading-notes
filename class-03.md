# Lists, Borders and More, Oh my!

There are 3 types of lists:
* Ordered List ```<ol>```: This list will be in numerical order.
* Unordered List ```<ul>```: Will not be in any particular order.
* Definition list ```<dl>```: Used to create words and their definitions.
Nested lists are lists inside a list element ```<li>```. The li stands for list item.

## Borders and Boxes

CSS give developers the ability to change the box size that naturally surrounds an element in html. The default box size is just big enough to hold its own content. The more content in the box the bigger the box will be, with limitations of course. 

Height and width of boxes can be changed using pixels (px), percentages or (ems). Limitations can be applied to the width and height of boxes as well. The purpose of limiting dimensions is render the webpage properly depending on screen size, think mobile device like Android or iPhone.
