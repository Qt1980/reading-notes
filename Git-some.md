## What's a Version Control System (VCS)?

A VCS is a system that allows you to revisit changes to files or sets of files. This is important because it prevents the loss of data while tracking updates or changes to a file or files. 

There are various types of VCS:

    - Local Version Control System (LVCS)
    - Central Version Control System (CVCS)
    - Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

GIT is a Distributed Version Control (DVCS) system that creates snapshots of changes to files stored in repositories on the GitHub platform. 
Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the linux kernel, created GIT in 2005 in response to the company that managed Bitkeeper cancelling the free use of its service.
Here's a chart of the workflow GIT uses.

Using GIT we can make changes to files by cloning our files stored on the repository located on GitHub using the ```git clone (website address)``` command. The address to each repository is unique. This is the checkout process that clones from the Repository to our local hard disk by using the ```git clone Https:...``` at the command terminal prompt.  
Now we can begin to make changes to files found in the repository stored on our local machine through a text editor. I'm using Microsoft's VS Code editor on my machine but you use whatever you feel comfortable with.
