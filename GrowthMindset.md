## Growth Mindset | What is it? 

A mindset of growth is simply a mindset that is inspired to keep you learning and moves you forward to push past what you thought you could do.

## **Ways You Can Stay in a Growth Mindset**
       - Allow for self discovery
       - Understand that failure is a learning tool
       - Appreciate your abiltiy to learn from your mistakes

As I like to say:
> Knowledge is indeed power.
> The knowledge of **_who_** you are is the most powerful knowledge anyone can attain and the power **_in_** who you are is absolute.
