# D.E.I. - Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

## What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

- During the decline of women in computer sciece marketers were using computers to target men and boys. It was viewed as a boys toy and women became uninterested when these computers started showing up as personal computers in the homes of American. 

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

- It matters because as boys and men played with computers their knowledge and interest in them grew. If technology is moving forward and it always does then anyone not accustomed with it from its start might feel as if it's too much to learn with the time they've been given to learn it. More importantly it matters because it causes a lack of diversity of minds. It was afterall African American women who figured out the algorithms and equations to put men on the moon.


Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

## What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

- When I look at the data it shows a clear bias. This isn't surprising to me. That bias sets an expectation and the expectation then set the experience of who should and should not be there. Clearly we live in a country born from founding fathers that although having wisdom to write the constitution lacked the ability to exercise that wisdom when it came to humanity. This is the justification of slavery and the stripping of land from indigenous peoples.
- These companies show me that those who are the offspring of those that came before having been priviledged as first and superior continue to benefit from that mentality. While others are ushered into other areas of work because of the established biases.
- I do see growth in some companies but the data doesn't lie and while we can see to whom is the benefactor of these companies from top to bottom we ultimately know that inherent biases set the stage and is still doing so.

Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent. In a recent blog post describing a partnership with Code2040, Slack Engineering Chief of Staff Nolan Caudill acknowledged: "Like almost every tech company, our own upbringings, biases and life experiences result in referral networks that are very homogeneous, and we know we are missing out on great candidates based on these shortcomings."

**Ask the question:**

## Why diversity matters to your tech company?

- Diversity matters fundamentally because people from diferent background will have different perspectives. Bringing these together will create more powerful solutions to problems. Unfortunately when I read the article from [USA Today](/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/) what I see is companies looking at DEI from a monitary investment standpoint not a human one. 

## When are diversity efforts most successful?

- Efforts are most successful when the team that is plotting out has diversity, equity and inclusion at its table, at its root. Too often company leaders who are caucasion try to tackle this without inviting people from other ethnicities. It is perhaps deserving of a good round of applause, perhaps. I have never seen that work without true and diverse representation sitting at the table. 

## Why do diverse companies perform better?

- This is due to the inclusion of different experiences. Different experiences create different perspectives which in turn produce vast levels of wisdom. It is easy to see how this would be beneficial to any business. Even knowing this we see company founders starting companies from the ground up and at the start the homogenous environment is set. 

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

- One example is facebook. Facebook is tracking everything and everyone. Instead of using this data to have an intentional and positive impact on communites they merely use it to make money of off people.
