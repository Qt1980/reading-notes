# Welcome to How Computers Work

## "What is a computer?"

A computer is a tool used to help process information by taking;
- Input
- Storing input
- Processing
- Output
Every computer at its core does these four things. Computer started out as massive machines that would take up an entire room and at first they were extremely slow.

**INPUT**

Input is information that the computer recieves. Input devices are things like a display monitor, the keyboard, the mouse, or touchpads on your cellphone. 

**STORING**

Once the information is recieved as input it is then stored in what is called the computer's *MEMORY*. When it is ready to be processed it will be taken from storage and sent to the cpu.

**PROCESS**

The input goes from storage into the *Central Processing Unit (cpu)* to be interpreted or processed. Once this is done the cpu then sends the new information back to storage to be saved until it is ready to be used. 

**OUTPUT**

Finally once the user or software reequests the information the cpu pull the "interpreted" results from store and displays it as output on the monitor or screen of your smartphone. Some output devices are the display or monitor, texts, printers, speaker and so on.

These functions are all interpreted by the cpu in the form of ones (1) and zeros (0). So when you type the letter "B" on your keyboard it is converted into ```<01000010> = B```. This is called a binary number. Binary numbers are the language of a computer. Every piece of information a computer recieves is turned into ones and zeros. The one and the zero respectively is called a bit. The more bits your cpu can process the faster it will be. The first computers could only process small amounts of data at a time that would take several minutes to accomplish. 

**CPU**

The cpu is made up of many smaller parts that have multiple circuits that are designed to do different things based on the task it is being asked to do. For instance your cpu has a component within it that is desinged to do math while another might be designed to do read a thermometer within the system to control heat. 

Computers are made up of fans, circuits, wires, plugs, chips and many other things. All of these components are what is known as hardware. In order for a computer to operate it needs an Operating System. You might be familiar with Microsofts Windows 10 or perhaps Windows XP or maybe you use apple products and are familiar with Sierra one of the older operating systems for MAC computers. Operating systems are a compilation os software used to control what the hardware does. It is also an interface for the user to interact with the hardware and software on the computer. 

 Todays computers are small, some even microscopic,extremely fast, efficient, able to handle multiple commands at once and compute complex algorithms simultaneously in the blink of an eye.
