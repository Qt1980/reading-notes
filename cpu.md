# Welcome to How Computers Work

## "What is a computer?"

A computer is a tool used to help process information by taking;
- Input
- Storing input
- Processing
- Output
Every computer at it's core does these four things. Computer started out as massive machines that would take up an entire room and at first they were extremely slow.

**INPUT**

Input is information that the computer recieves. Input devices are things like a display monitor, the keyboard, the mouse, or touchpads on your cellphone. 

**STORING**

Once the information is recieved as input it is then stored in what is called the computer's memory. When it is ready to be processed it will be taken from storage and sent to the cpu.

**PROCESS**

The input goes from storage into the Central Processing Unit (cpu)
