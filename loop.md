# Welcome to Loops and Operators

**Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions**

Here are different types of comparison operators;

    * Boolean: The evaluation by comparison that results in an answer of either true or false. 
The process of determining the Boolean is through comparing one value in the script to what is the expected result.
Example:   

    > if (a + b) = x
    > a=5, b=2
    > Therefore the answer must be 7 which is true.
    > If (a + b) does not equal 7 then the answer would be false. 

1. == : This copmarison operator means that the values are "equal to" and checks to see if the values are the same.
2. != : This comparison operator means that the values are "not equal" to each other.
3. === : This comparison operator means the values are "stricly equal" to each other.
4. !== : This comparison operator means tht values "do not" have the same data type and value.

Some familiar symbols (<,>) are greater and less than signs. They check to see if the values on the left are greater or less than that on the right. 

**Logical Operators**: Compares the results of more than one comparison operator. Example: ((5<2>)&& (2>=3))

**Logical And**: Compares more than one condition. If both expressions result in true then the total result is true. If any result is false then the total result is false.

**Logical Or**: Compares at lease one condition. If at least one expression returns true then the total result is true. 

**Logical Not**: Inverts a single value. If the expression returns true this operator will return the answer as false. 

**Loops**: Checks conditions of a code block. If the condition returns true then the loop will execute. The process will repeat until it returns false.
