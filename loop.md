**Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions**

Here are different types of comparison operators;

    * Boolean: The evaluation by comparison that results in an answer of either true or false. 
The process of determining the Boolean is through comparing one value in the script to what is the expected result.
Example:   

    > if (a + b) = x
    > a=5, b=2
    > Therefore the answer must be 7 which is true.
    > If (a + b) does not equal 7 then the answer would be false. 

1. '==' - This copmarison operator means that the values are "equal to" and checks to see if the values are the same.
