# Images, Color and Text in HTML

![HTML Structure Example](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgm6BBz6KbM/VuarmPKRJ1I/AAAAAAAAG4Q/5GDCRhO09IgiCE2DQXhA0OVaxlylGWvvw/s400/html-structure.png) This is an image I got from googling "HTML structure". This is an example of how images can be positions on a webpage. Here the image is inside the start of a paragraph. There are two other ways in which images can be placed. These are:

    * In the middle of a paragraph
    * Before a paragraph 
    * Inside the start of a paragraph

Some older code use the align element to align images from the top, middle, bottom or left and right sides of paragraph. Essentially they do the same thing as the above list but with the align element. HTML 5 does not use the align element however so be on the lookout for older code.

When using images for your website you want to alwas make sure you are saving the images in the correct format, at the right size and always measure them in pixels.

JPEG, GIF and PNG (When to use them)

1. JPEGs should be used when an image has many colors.
2. GIFs should be used when there in an abundance of flat colors or very few colors.
3. PNGs should also be used for images that have few and flat colors.

Editing and saving images can be done with tools like Adobe Photoshop. However photoshop is fairly expensive but there are other options like: Photoshop Elements, Pixelmator, Paint.net, Paintshop Pro and Adobe Fireworks and various online editors (p108 in the Ducketts HTML/CSS book).
