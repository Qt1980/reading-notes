# Images, Color and Text in HTML

```<img>``` is the element used in HTML to add images to a webpage. Within the element you must select the source of the image. This is done with the src (source) attribute. The element in full would appear in HTML as:

```<img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgm6BBz6KbM/VuarmPKRJ1I/AAAAAAAAG4Q/5GDCRhO09IgiCE2DQXhA0OVaxlylGWvvw/s400/html-structure.png">```

The ```<img>``` element does not need a closing tag and as you can see from the example above the attribute and image address sit inside the img element. The above image address is the same for the HTML Structure image below!

This is an example of how images can be positioned on a webpage. Here the image is inside the start of a paragraph. There are two other ways in which images can be placed. These are:

    * In the middle of a paragraph
    * Before a paragraph 

Some older code use the align element to align images from the top, middle, bottom or left and right sides of paragraph. Essentially they do the same thing as the above list but with the align element. HTML 5 does not use the align element however so be on the lookout for older code.

When using images for your website you want to alwas make sure you are saving the images in the correct format, at the right size and always measure them in pixels.

JPEG, GIF and PNG (When to use them)

1. JPEGs should be used when an image has many colors.
2. GIFs should be used when there in an abundance of flat colors or very few colors.
3. PNGs should also be used for images that have few and flat colors.

Editing and saving images can be done with tools like Adobe Photoshop. However photoshop is fairly expensive but there are other options like: Photoshop Elements, Pixelmator, Paint.net, Paintshop Pro and Adobe Fireworks and various online editors (p108 in the Ducketts HTML/CSS book).

When editing images be sure to consider its size, how to set the image (either in landscape or portrait) and how to properly crop it.

Images can even be animated. I've copied an image from Giphy.com to show an example. This is also another example of image placement. Here the image is being used in the middle of a paragraph.

Let's look at color next.

## Color

Using color you can create a more vibrant and catchy website. Color creates contrast between text and background colors so that your text is easier to read which your user would prefer. Using CSS you can select colors using   Values, Hex codes and color names. Let's define these terms.

**RGB Values**: RGB(Red, Green Blue) Values express colors in terms of how much red, green or blue is in a selected color. In other words these orimary colors are combined to get the color you might want or the colors are lessened for the same effect. Example: *rgb(100,100,90)*. 

HEX Codes: Six digit cods that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color. Example: #ee3e80
