# Qadree's Reading Notes for Coding 102

Welcome to Qadree's Reading Notes for Coding 102 at Code Fellows. Below is work that I've done as a brand new coder. I am very excited about the journey I've undertaken and if you've been thinking about jumping into coding I hope my work inspires you! Everything you intereact with on my webpage except for the template that it's rendered on is my work. This class has given me a greater understanding of the "behind the scenes" work that goes into what we see and use when we're interacting with our devices be it a car, smartphone, smart appliance etc. It is riveting to know the level of detail and work that brings you the ability to look at a webpage that has taken my code, rendered it so that you can interact! Please enjoy!
