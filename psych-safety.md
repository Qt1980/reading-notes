# Psychological Safety

Psych safety is a common ground mental/emotional setting create by members in a group that need to work together. The purpose of this is to create an efficient work ethic by ensuring that all members of the group are seen, heard and valued. This means checking in with members on a personal level, giving space to hear each other, and acknowledging the value in the opinions and perspectives of others as well.

Once this is done properly the team tends to do well when working together.
