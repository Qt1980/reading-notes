Before bouncing into building a webpage there are important question one should consider. Questions like:

     Why would someone visit your site?
     What are they looking for or trying to achieve?
     What information do they need?
     How often will they visit your site?

There are many other question to consider but we'll stick with those for now. Take some time to ponder those questions because having the answers will in turn prep you in how to structure your website.

First let's look at the how HTML structure a webpage.

Above is a very basic example of what HTML structure would look like as code. You can find many examples by googling "html structure images". 
For example within the body of an html:

```<body> Will be text that might explain what the body of the message on the page is about.</body>```. Looking at the image above you can see each element type as:

    ```<html>(Opening Tag) and </html>(Closing Tag)
       <head>(Opening Tag) and </head>(closing Tag)
       <body>(Opening Tag) and </body>(Closing Tag)```
