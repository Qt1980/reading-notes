# Object Literals and the DOM

What is an object in JavaSCript?

*Object*:

  Objects are representations of real world things that are made using variables and functions that are grouped together.

  Variables and functions used within objects operate the same way but are called by different names. In an object, a variable is called a property.

*Property:*

  Properties give information about the object like what the name of a park is. The park would be the object and the name *Pennyhill* would be the name or property of the park.

*Functions:*

  Within an object, functions are known as "methods". Methods are used to do tasks within the object. For instance, if you wanted to know how many more trees need to be planted in a park to get a total number of trees, you'd look at the total number of trees needed and then subtract the current number of trees planted.
