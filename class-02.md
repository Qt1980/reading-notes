# A cup of (Java) instructions

As mentioned earlier a script is a set of step by step instructions given to a computer to follow. Depending on the instructions are the computer is able to accomplish many things one by one or at dizzying speeds. 

Here is an example of script taken from the Duckett JS Book: 

```var greeting;```

```if (hourNow > 18) {```
   ``` greeting = 'Good evening!';```
```} else if (hourNow > 12) {```
   ``` greeting = 'Good afternoon!';```
```} else if (hourNow > 0) {```
   ``` greeting = 'Good morning!';```
```} else {```
   ``` greeting = 'Welcome!';```
```}```

This script expresses a greeting based on the time of day the user opens the webpage. Javascript can be used in many ways to make the webpage interactive and therefor more robust and enjoyable. 

Scripts are built using logic which involves putting together expressions and variables in the proper order. Expressions can be evaulated by assigning operators of which there are 5 types used in JavaScript. 

## Operators

    -Assignment: Assigns values to variable
    -Arithmetic: Performs basic math
    -String: Combines strings together using the plus sign (+)
    -Comparison: Compares two values and evaluates whether it is true or false
    -Logical: Combines expressions and evaluates whether it is true or false

*Variables* are used to temporarily hold information within scripts and can be assigned various values names. Some naming conventions are reserved within JavaScript and cannot be used.
