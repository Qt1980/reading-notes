# A cup of (Java) instructions

As mentioned earlier a script is a set of step by step instructions given to a computer to follow. Depending on the instructions are the computer is able to accomplish many things one by one or at dizzying speeds. 

Here is an example of script taken from the Duckett JS Book: 

```var greeting;```

```if (hourNow > 18) {```
   ``` greeting = 'Good evening!';```
```} else if (hourNow > 12) {```
   ``` greeting = 'Good afternoon!';```
```} else if (hourNow > 0) {```
   ``` greeting = 'Good morning!';```
```} else {```
   ``` greeting = 'Welcome!';```
```}```

This script expresses a greeting based on the time of day the user opens the webpage. Javascript can be used in many ways to make the webpage interactive and therefor more robust and enjoyable.
