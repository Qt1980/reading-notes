# Link, Layout and JavaScript Functions, Methods and Objects

## Link

As you might already know, links are used to take you from one webpage to another or even from one part of a website to another part of the same site. They are how we "Surf" or browse the web. Let's look at what the link looks like in html.

```<a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a>```

The opening and closing  ```<a></a>``` tag is how the link is started. Just inside the opening tag is the href attribute that allows us to specify which site address we want to link to. AS you can see in the above example the href attribute equals "https://apple.com" then the closing bracket of the opening tag is put in place. This isn't the same as the closing tag of the ```<a>``` element so be sure to pay attention to that. The word 'Apple' is typed right after and then the closing ```</a>``` tag is applied. When the page is rendered the browser knows to only display the word *Apple* and is usually blue in color to signify that it is a link. The user clicks on the link they will be taken to the website address that is equal to href, which in this case is "https://apple.com". See the actual clickable link below:
