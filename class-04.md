# Link, Layout and JavaScript Functions, Methods and Objects

## Link

As you might already know, links are used to take you from one webpage to another or even from one part of a website to another part of the same site. They are how we "Surf" or browse the web. Let's look at what the link looks like in html.

```<a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a>```

The opening and closing  ```<a></a>``` tag is how the link is started. Just inside the opening tag is the href attribute that allows us to specify which site address we want to link to. AS you can see in the above example the href attribute equals "https://apple.com" then the closing bracket of the opening tag is put in place. This isn't the same as the closing tag of the ```<a>``` element so be sure to pay attention to that. The word 'Apple' is typed right after and then the closing ```</a>``` tag is applied. When the page is rendered the browser knows to only display the word *Apple* and is usually blue in color to signify that it is a link. The user clicks on the link they will be taken to the website address that is equal to href, which in this case is "https://apple.com". This is considered an **_Absoulte_** URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) linking to another site outside of the site that you might currently be visiting. 

As stated earlier links can also take you to different parts of the same page. For instance you may want to visit the "Contact" section of a website but you are currently on the home page. If no link was present on the home page (usually near the bottom somewhere) how would you access the websites owners contact information? You would need a link to it. It may show up as a button or a words titled "Contact Us' that you can click on. That's the link! 

See the below example created by a student from Code Fellows: This is how links are created using markdown. Each link will take you to a differnt part of that website. These are all considered **_Relative_** URLs because they keep you in the same website address.
