# Using Markdown on GitHub

Markdown is a syntax tool used to format or style any form of writing on GitHub. Let's start with syntax. What is a "syntax"? Syntax is defined as
> The arrangement of words and phrases to create a well formed sentence in language.
So essentially, sentences and paragraphs, things we use everyday.
Markdown as mentioned above is an editing tool used to style the words, sentences and paragraphs on a webpage on the GitHub Pages platform.

Example: Using Markdown we can make a word bold or italic.
Let's use the word "clown". If we want it to be bold we would type clown with a double asterix before and after the word ```**clown **```=  **clown**.

If we wanted to make the word italic we would use only one asterix in front and only one in back of the word. It would look like this: ```*clown*``` = *clown*.

Typing clown without the double asterix before and after the word will leave the word in its regular form. When the entry is commits then it will appear bold on your webpage as shown above.

Markdown can be used in many differnt ways to edit text on your page. You can create links to other pages or websites, add images, create headers, quotes and more. 

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a platform that essentially hosts your webpage. GitHub provides tools, themes and simply instructions on how to create webpages using readme.md files stored in a repository. The .md extension is short for Markdown. Once you create the readme.md file you can began writing code which will appear on your website. For now just know that Github Pages is the place your website will be stored.
